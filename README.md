## FBLA Conference System

A web app created for Washington State FBLA for creating, managing, and allowing students to register for conferences at the regional and state levels.

The app was created using Visual Studio and written in C# with the .NET Framework (primarily ASP .NET). Initially, the database was provided by a local instance of Microsoft's SQL Server, but was later changed to use Azure SQL Database.
